# Job Application Coach
In this project I have started by gaining hands-on experience with Gradio, unlocking the potential of watsonx.ai's large language model, learning how to harness its power for real-world applications. By the end of this project, you've been adept at developing three specialized tools: an AI-driven resume enhancer, a personalized cover letter generator, and a strategic job hunting advisor.

"AI Career Coach" consists of three core components:
  - a resume enhancement tool
  - a personalized cover letter generator
  - a career advice application
