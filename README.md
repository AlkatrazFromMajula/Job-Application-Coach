# Job Application Coach

In this project I have started by gaining hands-on experience with Gradio, unlocking the potential of watsonx.ai's large language model, learning how to harness its power for real-world applications. By the end of this project, you've been adept at developing three specialized tools: an AI-driven resume enhancer, a personalized cover letter generator, and a strategic job hunting advisor.

"AI Career Coach" is more than just a learning experience; it's a stepping stone to a future where AI bridges the gap between talent and opportunity.
It consists of three core components:
  - a resume enhancement tool
  - a personalized cover letter generator
  - a career advice application

# Resume Enhancement Tool 
An application that uses AI to analyze and improve resumes based on job descriptions.


# Personalized Cover Letter Generator
An AI application that drafts customized cover letters, enhancing job application processes.


# Career Advice Application 
An innovative tool that offers personalized job hunting and career improvement advice based on AI analysis of resumes and job descriptions.
